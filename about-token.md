Excellent question — and one that touches both security and design clarity in JWT-based authentication.

✅ Best Practice: Return token and user info separately
Here’s why this is preferred:

1. Security & Token Size
JWTs should be compact and contain only what's necessary for authentication and authorization.

Embedding full user info (like email, role, etc.) in the token increases its size and risk exposure if leaked.

Minimal claims like user_id, exp, and role are enough for backend validation.

2. Privacy & Flexibility
If you include sensitive user info in the token (e.g., email, phone), it’s visible to anyone who decodes it — even if it’s signed.

Keeping user info separate allows you to control what’s exposed and update it dynamically without regenerating tokens.

3. Frontend Simplicity
Returning user info alongside the token (in the response body) makes it easy for the frontend to store and display user details without decoding the token.

Example:

json
{
  "access": "jwt-access-token",
  "refresh": "jwt-refresh-token",
  "user": {
    "id": 12,
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "seller"
  }
}
🔐 What Should Be in the Token?
Only include claims that:

Are needed for authorization checks (e.g., role, user_id)

Are safe to expose (no PII like email or phone)

Are static during the token’s lifetime

🧠 Summary
Strategy	Best Practice
Token contains full user info	❌ Not recommended
Token contains minimal claims	✅ Yes
User info returned separately	✅ Yes
So your current approach — returning access, refresh, and a separate user object — is spot-on. Let me know if you want to explore token rotation, refresh flows, or securing tokens in localStorage vs. cookies.

The best practice when using JWT for login is to return the token and user info separately — not embed full user details inside the token. Here's why this approach is both secure and scalable:

✅ Why Return Token and User Info Separately
1. Security First
JWTs are signed but not encrypted, meaning anyone with the token can decode its payload.

Embedding sensitive data like email, phone, or full profile info exposes it to potential misuse if the token is leaked.

Keeping the token minimal (e.g., user_id, role, exp) reduces risk and attack surface.

2. Smaller Token Size
JWTs are passed with every request — bloated tokens slow down performance.

A lean token improves efficiency, especially on mobile or low-bandwidth connections.

3. Dynamic User Info
If user data changes (e.g., email update), you’d have to regenerate the token if it’s embedded.

Returning user info separately allows the frontend to fetch fresh data without touching the token.

4. Frontend Simplicity
Returning user info in the login response makes it easy for the frontend to display user details without decoding the token.

🔐 What Should Be in the Token?
Include only what’s needed for authorization:

json
{
  "user_id": 42,
  "role": "seller",
  "exp": 1700000000
}
Avoid putting:

Email

Full name

Phone number

Address

Any PII (personally identifiable information)

🧠 Summary
Practice	Recommended
Token contains full user info	❌ No
Token contains minimal claims	✅ Yes
User info returned separately	✅ Yes
Your current setup — returning access, refresh, and a separate user object — is exactly what modern, secure APIs do. If you ever want to explore token rotation, refresh flows, or cookie-based storage, I can help you weigh those too.
